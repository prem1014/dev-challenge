                            I have created an app js file that init the application and subscribe to stomp client.
                            App js also makes call to dataTable method to create data table.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a data table module which takes table headers and row data and create the data table.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A mid price module is responsible to calculate the mid price and draw the sparkline graph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added Jasmine and set up the unit testing. I have added unit test for one module.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If i would be allowed to use any library or framework, I would prefer react. Updating dom based
                        on server response is very expensive and makes the page to not perform well. React Virtual dom and
                        and it's dom updation feature can make this page to perform more better as we are doing dom updation on every
                        response from stomp client.
                    </li>
